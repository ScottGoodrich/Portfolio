                <p>To my surprise, I was born in Burlington, Vermont in 1977. Didn't see that coming.
                    <br><br>I spent my early years playing with my dog, gorging myself on so many tomatoes from the garden that my skin turned red, and (according to my mother) finding all the dead flies I could on windowsills around the house and eating them before she could stop me.<br>
                    <br>My family relocated to San Diego—my mom's hometown—when I was young, where I grew up and fostered my love for the graphic arts, baseball, reading and music. I unfortunately was unable to make a career out of any of those pursuits. Still a practicing amateur though.<br>
                    <br>I am an aspiring web developer, former aspiring rock star, and current aspiring ex-bartender. I have a beautiful and supportive wife and a nine-year-old daughter who is smart, funny, sarcastic and now happens to be learning to code also. Life ain't so bad.
